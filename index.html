        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Although I obtained a Business Management degree, I lacked the passion to pursue a business career. 
            Instead, I became interested in programming after reflecting on my high school IT classes and seeing
             the captivating programming projects my computer science friends had created. Although I previously 
             thought I needed a 4-year computer science or STEM degree to work in tech, I discovered that many 
             people without such degrees had landed software engineering jobs after completing coding bootcamps. 
            <br>
             Therefore, I enrolled in an online full-stack bootcamp, which I recently completed. I thoroughly 
             enjoyed the programming community and the "a-ha" moments that come with coding. 
             I'm eager to secure my first programming job and continue to expand my skills.
